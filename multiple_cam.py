# Grab_MultipleCameras.cpp
# ============================================================================
# This sample illustrates how to grab and process images from multiple cameras
# using the CInstantCameraArray class. The CInstantCameraArray class represents
# an array of instant camera objects. It provides almost the same interface
# as the instant camera for grabbing.
# The main purpose of the CInstantCameraArray is to simplify waiting for images and
# camera events of multiple cameras in one thread. This is done by providing a single
# RetrieveResult method for all cameras in the array.
# Alternatively, the grabbing can be started using the internal grab loop threads
# of all cameras in the CInstantCameraArray. The grabbed images can then be processed by one or more
# image event handlers. Please note that this is not shown in this example.

# Limits the amount of cameras used for grabbing.
# It is important to manage the available bandwidth when grabbing with multiple cameras.
# This applies, for instance, if two GigE cameras are connected to the same network adapter via a switch.
# To manage the bandwidth, the GevSCPD interpacket delay parameter and the GevSCFTD transmission delay
# parameter can be set for each GigE camera device.
# The "Controlling Packet Transmission Timing with the Interpacket and Frame Transmission Delays on Basler GigE Vision Cameras"
# Application Notes (AW000649xx000)
# provide more information about this topic.
# The bandwidth used by a FireWire camera device can be limited by adjusting the packet size.
